# SQL Prep Test

Welcome to the SQL Prep Test! This is a hands-on resource built to help you practice and master SQL skills commonly evaluated in technical interviews. This test was developed based on direct feedback from employers across tech, finance, and data-driven industries, ensuring you're learning what's most relevant to real-world hiring expectations.

Whether you're brushing up before an interview, building a portfolio, or strengthening your resume, this project is designed to give you the confidence and fluency needed to succeed.

## What You'll Cover
This test covers a range of SQL concepts, gradually increasing in complexity:

### Core SQL Concepts
- SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses
- ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and HAVING
- Filtering and sorting data
- Table aliasing

### Intermediate to Advanced Techniques
- JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)
- Aggregation with functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), etc.
- CASE statements for conditional logic
- Creating and querying VIEWS
- Subqueries and nested SELECTs

Each section includes practical exercises that mimic the style and difficulty of real interview questions, allowing you to apply your knowledge immediately.

## Why This Matters
SQL is a foundational skill for roles in data analytics, business intelligence, and backend development. Listing SQL on your resume means you're ready to:
- Answer technical questions with confidence in interviews
- Interpret and manipulate real-world data
- Solve practical business problems using structured queries

This prep test not only reinforces your syntax knowledge but helps you think like an analystâ€”applying logic to clean, join, and extract insights from data.

## whats what in the files

- `db_builder.py` - This file sets up the data for you just run it
- `class_test.py` - This has all the test the are pulled into the final notebook 
- `final.ipynb` - This is the notebook you will work in to do all the queries. 


## To run this project
- Fork the repo 
- Make a Virtual Environment 
- Run the `db_builder.py` file 
- Then start with the `final.ipynb` 
- The code cells all have triple quotes and your query here. Just remove "your query here" and put yours in. 
```python
select_query = """
YOUR QUERY HERE
"""
```

## Virtual Environment Commands
| Command | Linux/Mac | GitBash |
| ------- | --------- | ------- |
| Create | `python3 -m venv venv` | `python -m venv venv` |
| Activate | `source venv/bin/activate` | `source venv/Scripts/activate` |
| Install | `pip install -r requirements.txt` | `pip install -r requirements.txt` |
